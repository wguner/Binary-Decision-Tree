# Binary Decision Tree
using pyeda library.

A binary decision diagram is a rooted, directed, acyclic graph. 

Nonterminal nodes in such a graph are called decision nodes and these nodes are represented by a boolean variable and has two child nodes.

BDDs are a Shannon expansion used for data compression.
